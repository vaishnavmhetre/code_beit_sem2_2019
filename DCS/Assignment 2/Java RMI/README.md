# Remote Method Invocation (RMI)

We've implemented communication between a Server and Client using Java RMI

## Steps to execute 

Go to the base of the project and run `rmiregistry`

(run server before running client)

  To run Server
    `java Worker server`
    
  To run Client
    `java Worker client <any string>`
